<p>During this session we find our party being awoken to some serious culty shit. After 70 years you found yourselves awakened with a ravenous hunger, confused and strapped down to tables in a dark and damp warehouse basement.</p>
<p>A man is quietly reciting some unfamiliar language and offers a paultry amount of vampire blood to each of you. To my suprise you calmly ask what is his plans are with you. He quickly finishes what only can be described as a "blood ritual" and offers his welcome to you, his newly awakened <em>friends.</em>
He informs you that you inturned yourselves willingly, for the revival by the Heralds of the Sun, an acient Mithriac cult you convenitenly forgot you were a part of, somewhat like the LDS, but with blood, well more blood. 
Once again, you've surprisly shown no threat, Aledino removes one of your restraints to have you free each other. He offers you "breakfast"" Jack is the only one to fully slates his hunger (hobo #2, ew) the rest of you just snack. <br>You get dressed from a collection of clothes in bags on the floor, Dracula went with a Jim Morrison look, Jason looks to be from a 1970s prom, Milton went with the tweed suit, ol professor style standby. Jack picked ASSLESS chaps and a vest as he never got back to me on discord...</p>
<p>The surviving captives were glamored by domination (Scott) and Draculas memory was wiped (aversion to human feeding). You all proceed to an office, though Milton noticed the ruins under a tarp in the warehouse, Jack can sense the proximety to the river Thames. You now are aware you are in Museum restoration basement, full of Mitraic artifacts. <br>
  In the office you again insist on finding out your purpose. You meet a man named Shirazi and his is overjoyed the ritual worked (you very well may have truely died in the process) and seems more concerned with that than your actual assignment. Another Vampire, Mickey Wheeler seems nonplused and skeptical about your arrival.<br>
  You are given <strong>1000 pounds</strong> and <strong>4 burner phones.</strong> As you are unaware of recent tech, Mickey impatiently shows you how they function. You are FASCINATED with the game "Snake".
  FINALLY you are given a letter from Pater of the Sun, a higher up the the cult. 
  It informs you that you are tasked to retrieve 4 relics to ressurect Mithras (your Jim Jones). </p>
<ol>
  <li>A Clay Seal</li>
  <li>A Silver Ring</li>
  <li>A Bronze Dagger</li>
  <li>A Phrygian Cap (wft?)</li>
  </ol>
<p> Shirazi produces a fifth relic. It is the same goblet you drank from eariler. As you are deciding what your next artifact to collect is, and why Marios ass cheeks are out, a small metallic bird thing is hovering right outside the window... then, several loud gunshots.
